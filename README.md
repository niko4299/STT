# STT
Speech to text project

Using various tutorials, I built a neural network to convert speech to text and then transferred the trained model to a mobile platform and used it there. At the moment, in mobile application I'm not getting the desired outputs but I will try to fix that in the future. Model building and training was preformed on Google Colab using Pytorch framework.

Inside folder "Model" there is a file "stt.ipynb" and in that file you can find how to build and train model and in folder "STTapp" there is an Android app.
